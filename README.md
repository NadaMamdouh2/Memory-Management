# Memory-Management
You will develop a memory allocation simulator to allocate
variable-sized partitions of the memory to a given sequence of
processes requests. Apply different allocation policies:
1. First-Fit policy.
2. Best-Fit policy.
3. Worst-Fit policy.
‚óè Add compaction (as option for the user): in compaction you shuffle
the memory contents so as to place all free memory together in one
large block.
Input will be as follows:
- Number of partition
- Partition name and its size.
- Number of process requests.
- Process name and its size.
- Selected policy by the user
